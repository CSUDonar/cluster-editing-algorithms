This project contains implementations of cluster editing algorithms with search trees of sizes O(3<sup>k</sup>), O(2.62<sup>k</sup>) and O(2<sup>k</sup>). It also contains a partial implementation of a cluster editing algorithm with search tree of size O(1.82<sup>k</sup>).

The O(2.62<sup>k</sup>)-, O(2<sup>k</sup>)-, and O(1.82<sup>k</sup>)-algorithms are described in the paper "Going weighted - parameterized algorithms for cluster editing.", authored by BÃ¶cker et al. in 2008.

The O(3^k)-algorithm is described by R. Niedermeier and J. Guo in their lecture slides available here: http://theinf1.informatik.uni-jena.de/teaching/niedermeier-guo-fpt.pdf

Tools for representing three different data sets as graphs are also supplied.

This project was originally developed as part of a bachelor project at Chalmers university of technology. For more information, read the project report available in the doc directory and see the README file.

Programming languages used: C, Java.
